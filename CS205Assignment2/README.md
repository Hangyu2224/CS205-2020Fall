7.To host your source code at GitHub.com is an option. You are strongly recommended to create a repository at GitHub.com to hold your source code for this assignment. If so, you can just put a link in the report of the assignment, and do not need to upload the source code to Blackboard. If you do not host your source code at GitHub.com, please upload your source with your report to Blackboard.

### Rules:
1.Please submit your assignment report before its deadline. After the deadline (even 1 second), 0 score!
(For students who register this course before Sep. 6, they should submit their assignment reports before 23:59 on Sep. 27. For the rest students they should submit their assignment reports in two weeks after they register.)

2.If you only implement requirement 1 and 2, the upper boundary of your score is 80. For a better score, you should implement the rest requirements. You score will also depend on the quality of your source code and your report. Your report should be easy to understand and describe your work well, especially the highlights of your work.

3.Please pay more attention to your code style. After all this is not ACM-ICPC contest. You have enough time to write code with both correct result and good code style. You will get deduction if your code style is terrible. You can read Google C++ Style Guide (http://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html ) or some other guide for code style.
